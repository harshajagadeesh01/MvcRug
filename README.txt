1:27 commented out sslPort on launhSetting.json and tested the initial output..Output is working....

1:45 Tested the intitial index and welcome method and then modified the welcome method to include two parameters..Finished part 2..

2:05 modified both index and welcome methods in the HelloWorldConteroller.cs to include view template and modified the style and names in _Layout.cshtml and finished Part 3

Used Packet Manager Console to run the command: Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

Scaffolded the movie pages and did the initial migration and finished Part 5

Could not get the program to run because of the computer error An unhandled exception occurred while processing the request (InvalidOperationException: No service for type 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UserManager`1[Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.IdentityUser]' has been registered.)

Restarted from scratch and did all the steps again in a different computer and still encountered An unhandled exception occurred while processing the request. Tried repeating all the steps on multiple computers and still ran into the same issue. Should have started earlier and there's nothing i can do about it now.

Seeded the database and initialized with default values for the Rug Product's characteristics

Created a github repository named 'MvcRug' to upload / commit all the MvcRug application files to github
